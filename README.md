# Object-detection-deep-learning
An object detection using OpenCV and the MobileNet SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model, which is a pre-trained deep learning model for detecting objects in images or video streams. The setup involves:

MobileNet SSD Architecture:

MobileNet: A lightweight deep neural network optimized for mobile and embedded devices. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computation.
SSD: A single-shot detector that efficiently predicts object classes and bounding boxes in one forward pass of the network.
Caffe Model and Prototxt:
The model weights are stored in a .caffemodel file, while the .prototxt file defines the network architecture, including the layers and parameters.
These files work together to specify how the network processes input data and makes predictions.
OpenCV Integration: OpenCVâ€™s cv2.dnn module allows loading the MobileNet SSD model to perform inference on images or videos.
It supports operations like loading frames, resizing, normalizing, and forwarding through the network to detect objects.
Object Detection Process: The image or video is preprocessed (resized, normalized, etc.) and passed through the network.
The network outputs bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels for detected objects.
Post-processing filters detections based on a confidence threshold.
Real-time object detection in surveillance systems, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and mobile devices.
